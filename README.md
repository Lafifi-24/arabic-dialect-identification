# Arabic-dialect-identification
the project aims to develop an NLP system that can accurately identify the dialect of an Arabic text.
We used a combination of pre-trained BERT models, Naive Bayes Multinomial, Random Forest, and fine-tuning techniques along with large datasets to train and test the system.
The goal is to improve the accuracy of identifying the dialect of Arabic text.
